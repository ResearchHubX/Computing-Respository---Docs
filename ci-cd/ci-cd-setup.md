# Documentation:
# This GitHub Actions workflow is meant to be implemented in the CRPR **code repository**
# under `.github/workflows/django-ci.yml`. It automates the following:
# 1. **Build & Test:** Runs on every push or pull request to `main`.
# 2. **Migrations:** Applies database migrations.
# 3. **Security Checks:** Uses Bandit for security scanning.
# 4. **Deployment:** Deploys the application after successful tests.
# 
# Ensure the necessary cloud deployment commands are added under the `deploy` job.
